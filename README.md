# Prop Hunt

Were you one of the many people who played prop hunt on Garry's Mod back in the day?
Do you miss the shenanigans of getting together with your friends and disguising yourself
as a bowl of soup? Then this is the plugin for you.

## What is it?

Prop Hunt allows you to disguise yourself as an in game model while your friends
do their best to try and track you down.

## How does it work?

Gather your friends and type their usernames (comma separated) in the Players
field in the plugin settings.

The hiders should turn on hide mode and select whatever model they like from the drop down.
The seeker(s) can go crazy and try and find them.

This plugin works best with player indicators off!

## How do I win?

That's really for you to decide. This plugin is left open, so you can create your own win conditions
or rules around the idea of hiding as a game object!
